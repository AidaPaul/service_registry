## About

If I get this project idea correctly, it's more like a test to play around and show that knows how to use python, flask, git, tests, etc.
So, I just implemented a simple API following the behave tests.

## Instructions

#### Create a virtualenv
```python3.6 -m venv /var/virtual_envs/service_registry```

#### Get into the venv
```source /var/virtual_envs/service_registry/bin/activate```

#### Install the packages
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

#### Run the project
```python app.py```

#### Access the local server
```http://localhost:5000/services```

#### Testing with behave
Just run `behave` in the root directory. The package is among the requirements and should be installed.
